### Challenge Goals
The aim is to model the electricity price from weather, energy (commodities) and commercial data for two European countries - France and Germany. The problem here is to explain the electricity price with simultaneous variables and thus this is not a prediction problem. More precisely, the goal of this challenge is to learn a model that outputs from these explanatory variables a good estimation for the daily price variation of electricity futures) contracts, in France and Germany. The metrics of evaluating performance is the spearman correlation coefficient. The benchark for this challenge consists in a simple linear regression, after a light cleaning of the data: The missing (NaN) values are simply filled with 0's and the COUNTRY column is dropped - namely we use the same model for France and Germany. The public score obtained with this benchmark is 15.86%.

### My Approach
In the initial preprocessing phase, I prepared the dataset for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by employing skewness-reducing transformations and ensuring uniformity through centering and scaling procedures. Subsequently, I conducted a series of experiments utilizing Lasso regression for effective feature selection and PCA for dimensionality reduction. These steps aimed to distill the most relevant information from the dataset. In pursuit of optimizing model performance, I leveraged Optuna for hyperparameter tuning on neural networks and random forest regression.

### My Result
After an extensive search in the hyperparameter space and different preprocessing procedures, the resulting configuration yielded a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.3541, indicating a moderate positive monotonic relationship between the predicted and actual values. In the specific context of daily volaility of european electricity futures, a spearman correlation of 0.3541 is relatively significant, underscoring the model's capacity to capture and predict relevant patterns in this dynamic and complex market. Through experimentation, it was revealed that optimal performance was achieved when employing PCA exclusively and not incorporating Lasso regularization. The Lasso regularization removed an excessive number of features, and it turned out that a considerable portion of these features held predictive value. Optimal results were obtained by utilizing neural networks instead of random forest regression.
